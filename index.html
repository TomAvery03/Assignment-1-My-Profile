    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I was born in Victor Harbor – a town about 70km south of Adelaide. I grew up in and around Adelaide’s outer suburbs – attending Eden Hills Primary from 2009-2016, and then Adelaide High from 2017-2021. I am a third generation Australian of mainly English, German, Swedish, and Welsh descent. I am not too connected with my ancestry as all my living relatives were born in Australia. After completing year 12, I moved in with my grandparents. I have settled into Melbourne life quite well. I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to stay at my grandparents many times throughout my childhood. It has made the transition into this new life much easier. My favourite sport is Australian Rules football. At the beginning of the year, I joined the Heathmont Jets. I saw it as a good opportunity to make new friends as well as keeping fit and most of all - having fun. I also enjoy watching my favourite team – the Collingwood Magpies – when they’re playing well of course. As a kid from Adelaide, it was never easy being a Collingwood supporter and it hasn’t gotten any easier being one in Melbourne. My dad introduced me to the club when I was seven and I have loved the club since – I hope to one day do the same for my kids. I think it would be fair to say that we almost treat footy like a religion. It’s a way of life. We watch, we play, and we talk it. footy has made us a tighter family.

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
    <p>My interest in IT stemmed from just being amongst technology from an early age. Using computers, apps and even learning to program in high school, fuelled an interest and understanding into the skeletal structure of various technology and programs. I became interested in the programming aspect of IT when I learnt HTML and Python in my year 11 Digital Tech class. Although I haven’t maintained a lot of my knowledge and skills, I am still excited and willing to learn more complex code for these languages. The side of coding that had appealed to me was the problem solving aspect. I almost treated errors like a game or a puzzle and would receive great satisfaction from fixing code – even if I was the cause of those errors. I even enjoyed the mechanical side of technology. During my teen years, I would often pull apart my old broken tech with an interest in discovering the gears of my machines. This interest led to me putting together my own PC. I have been fortunate to have grown up in a time where IT is everywhere and progressing at a rate that history has never seen. I want to be a part of this exciting new wave of technological advancement and that is why I chose to study a course in this field.

    <h3>Why I chose to come to RMIT?</h3>
      <p>Despite being very comfortable in Adelaide, I wanted to experience life in Melbourne. I had always wanted to live in Melbourne and the opportunity was offered to me mid-way through 2021. At that stage, I knew that I was coming over for university but I hadn’t yet considered a campus or an area that I wanted to study. I looked at what I really enjoyed in High School and that was coding. I knew I wanted to do something in that area. For conveniences-sake, I needed a university campus that was in close proximity to a train station – the RMIT City campus ticked this box. I chose RMIT as it’s often held in a high regard for its education and social opportunities. Its location within the heart of the Melbourne CBD was a great opportunity for me to discover my new city.</p>

    <h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
      <p>In my studies I expect to learn how to develop and manage databases, websites, and software. I also expect to improve and acquire new skills that don’t necessarily relate to IT. Skills like conducting interviews & surveys, time management, and critical thinking. These skills will still be useful and crucial in any career, not just ones in the IT industry. They will be particularly beneficial if I decide to pursue postgraduate studies in the IT field.

      <h2>Ideal Job<h2>
        <i><a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/software-and-applications-programmers?occupationCode=2613" id="logo">Software and Applications Programmer</a></i>
        <img src ="images\job.jpg" alt ="Job" style="margin: 10px;float:left;height:350px;">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Software and Applications Programmer designs and develops code with the addition of maintaining it to keep up with the user's needs (JobOutlook, n.d.). This specific job appeals to me because I can see my future self in this particular role. I consider myself to be captivated and knowledgeable when it comes to dealing with computing hardware and software. I prioritise enjoyment over payment and a Software and Applications Programmer requires skills in the aspects of IT that I enjoy; programming, problem solving, and analysing. If I enjoy my job, I am more likely to perform well. There’s also very strong future growth meaning there should always be job opportunities making it a safe career option.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills I need</h3>
          <p>To become a Software and Applications Programmer I will need at least 5 years of training or experience, or a Bachelor Degree or higher (JobOutlook, n.d.). This job requires a high skill level and a good understanding of the programming languages that will be used in the job itself. Having a good understanding means having good coding habits for the sake of organisation, as well as to make problem solving easier if there were something to go wrong. This problem solving involves being able to easily diagnose issues, then having the ability to debug and resolve them (JobOutlook, n.d.). I will also need to have good judgement so I can make decisions that will benefit the software or program in the short and long term (JobOutlook, n.d.). In this job I will need to evaluate how well a system is working and see if it can be improved. To do this, I will need to understand how a system works and the effect on the system if the programming is to be altered (JobOutlook, n.d.).
          </p>

        <h3>Skills I have</h3>
        <p>In regards to programming, I have basic knowledge in HTML and Python. I believe I am generally a good decision maker as I often think long and hard about any decision regardless of its potential level of impact. I always like to keep organised, often planning things well in advance and keeping track of my tasks. Time management is important in a career like this, especially when problems can occur unexpectedly.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning plan</h3>
        <p>To maintain and improve my programming and decision-making skills, I will need to consistently practice complex programming while keeping good habits within the respective languages that I will be using. I will be able to acquire the skills and experience needed for this job during my studies; from working and communicating with others, to programming – including solving problems, and evaluating and analysing systems.

        <h2>Personal profile<h2>
          <h3>16 personalities</h3>

          <h3>Big five personality test</h3>
          <img src ="images\big5.jpg" alt ="Big five personality test results" style="margin: 10px;float:left;height:300px;">
          <p>The results from these tests are just about what I expected them to be. I usually don’t tend to pay attention to tests like these. I could see myself using these as a tool to improve or change certain parts of my personality. I didn’t expect to be as turbulent as the 16Personalities test said I was. I also figured I was a little more introverted. These results suggest I should be more assertive and more of a leader when working in a team. It will be important for the group's sake to have members that portray traits that are somewhat absent from myself. When forming a team, this data may be useful to find members that complement and/or contrast these traits. Since I am not very assertive, I could find a member that portrays leadership skills. Having said that, I don’t think I will really take this data into consideration when choosing group members. If I'm going to be honest, I’ll just be looking for the intelligent and hard workers.</p>
